## Introduction:

### 1. Motivation: LLMs as Components in an ML Pipeline

Solving a task using machine learning methods requires a series of steps that often require large amounts of human effort or labor. Some examples of this are (i) data collection, (ii) data curation
or something similar, (iii) data labeling, (iv) data augmentation, etc. Furthermore there might be more steps after the training the ML model, such as evaluation, explaining the behavior of the model,
interpreting model outputs, etc. Many of these steps are also often human labor intensive. In this project, we will investigate how to effectively use Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate various aspects of this pipeline.

### 2. Our Proposal
We're aiming to create a automated system that makes applying for jobs a breeze. Job hunting has many stages, and we see a chance to automate things and use LLM (Language Model) to make it even smoother. We're looking at different ways, both the usual and some new ideas, to integrate LLM into the job application process. The goal is to reduce how much you have to do and let LLM do its thing, making the whole process easier for you.
