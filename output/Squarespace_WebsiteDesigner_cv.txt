Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the position of Website Designer at Squarespace. With over 4 years of experience in software development, including website design and development, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your team and deliver exceptional results.

In my previous role as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Tiger Analytics, I spearheaded the development of interactive dashboards, ML models, and web applications for optimizing value in the petcare sector. This experience honed my skills in designing visually appealing layouts and graphics and optimizing websites for user experience and functionality. I am well-versed in HTML, CSS, and graphic design software such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.

At Winjit Technologies, as a Software Engineer, I designed and developed RESTful APIs, low-latency responsive UI/UX application features, and large-scale databases. These projects required me to stay updated with current design trends and industry best practices, ensuring compatibility across different browsers and devices. I also gained experience in working closely with clients from different industries, gathering their requirements and delivering customized solutions.

Furthermore, my background as a Deep Learning Engineer at Automation Teknix and a Research Intern at IMATMI equipped me with a strong understanding of user experience principles, web programming languages, and SEO optimization techniques.

In addition to my technical skills, I bring excellent communication and interpersonal skills, allowing me to effectively collaborate with clients and team members. I am self-driven and able to work creatively and independently, ensuring timely project delivery.

Squarespace's mission to provide elegant, intuitive, and powerful tools to help people bring their creative ideas to life on the web aligns perfectly with my passion for crafting visually appealing and user-friendly website templates. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your exceptional online experiences.

Please find attached my resume and portfolio showcasing my previous website design projects. I am available for an interview at your convenience to discuss how my skills and experiences can contribute to Squarespace's success.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Saurabh Bhausaheb Zinjad
